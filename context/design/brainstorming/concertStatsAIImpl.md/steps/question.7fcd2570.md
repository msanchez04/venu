# question: how can I now implement this concertEvent concept based on the venu concept deign after the completion of the mediaAlbum concept. I also want to use this api from the web: https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz\_API to provide the artist suggestions so that it is not a hallucination how can I incorporate that?
