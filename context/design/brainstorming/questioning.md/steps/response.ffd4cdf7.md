# response:

The provided response does not answer your question. It appears to be an answer to "Why are apples red?" instead of "How old is the Earth?"

Here is the correct answer to your question:

That's one of the most fundamental questions in science! The scientific consensus is that the Earth is approximately:

### **4.54 billion years old** (plus or minus about 50 million years).

This age is not just a guess; it's a figure supported by multiple lines of scientific evidence gathered over many decades.

### How Do We Know This?

The primary method used to determine the age of the Earth is called **radiometric dating**.

Here’s a simple breakdown of how it works:

1. **Cosmic Clocks:** Certain natural elements, like uranium, are radioactive. This means their atoms are unstable and "decay" over time, transforming into a different, more stable element (in the case of uranium, it eventually turns into lead).
2. **A Predictable Rate:** This decay happens at a very precise and predictable rate, known as a "half-life." A half-life is the amount of time it takes for half of the original radioactive atoms (the "parent" element) to decay into the new, stable atoms (the "daughter" element).
3. **Measuring the Ratio:** By measuring the ratio of the parent element to the daughter element in a rock sample, scientists can calculate how many half-lives have passed since that rock first formed and solidified. This allows them to determine the rock's age.

### Why Not Just Date Earth Rocks?

Finding the Earth's true age is tricky because our planet is geologically active. The processes of plate tectonics, erosion, and volcanism are constantly recycling the Earth's crust. Because of this, the oldest rocks ever found on Earth's surface are "only" about 4 billion years old. Most of the original crust has been destroyed and reformed.

To find the age of the planet as a whole, scientists had to look beyond Earth itself.

### The Key Evidence: Meteorites

The most crucial evidence for Earth's age comes from **meteorites**. These are rocks from space that have fallen to Earth.

* **Pristine Samples:** Meteorites are remnants from the formation of our solar system. They are essentially leftover building blocks that were never incorporated into a planet.
* **A Shared Birthday:** Scientists operate on the well-supported theory that all the bodies in our solar system (the sun, planets, asteroids) formed from the same cloud of gas and dust at roughly the same time.
* **The Final Answer:** By applying radiometric dating to these meteorites, scientists consistently get an age of **4.54 billion years**. Because these meteorites formed at the same time as the Earth, their age is considered the age of our entire solar system, including our planet. This age is also corroborated by the age of the oldest Moon rocks brought back by the Apollo missions.

So, in short: **By dating meteorites—the pristine leftovers from the birth of our solar system—scientists have determined the Earth is about 4.54 billion years old.**
