# response:

Excellent question! This is a great point to be at. The good news is that your test file is **already perfectly written and structured to be tested with Deno.** You don't need to modify the file's content at all.

The file is already using:

* Deno's standard BDD testing library (`describe`, `it`, `beforeEach`, `afterAll`).
* The correct import syntax for JSR (`jsr:@std/assert`), npm (`npm:mongodb`), and your local project aliases (`@utils/`, `@concepts/`).

The missing piece isn't in the file itself, but in **how you run it from the command line.**
