# solution:

The solution is to create a `deno.json` file in the root of your project. This file will serve three purposes:

1. Define all your external dependencies in a single, clear location using an `importMap`.
2. Allow you to use clean, "bare specifier" imports in your code (e.g., `from "std/assert/mod.ts"` instead of the full URL).
3. Define convenient scripts (like a test script) using the `tasks` field, so you don't have to type out long commands with all the permission flags every time.

Here are the steps to fix this:

### 1. Create a `deno.json` file

Create a file named `deno.json` in the root directory of your project and add the following content. This defines aliases for all the dependencies used in the test file.
