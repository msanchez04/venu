# solution:

The solution is two-fold:

1. **Make the teardown logic more robust.** Your `finally` block should always check if the connection was successfully established before trying to close it. This will fix the immediate error and is a crucial best practice.
2. **Investigate why `testDb()` is failing.** The robust teardown will stop the test runner from crashing, allowing you to see the *real*, underlying error from the database connection.

### 1. The Code Fix: Robust Teardown

Update your test file to check if `client` exists before trying to call `.close()` on it. This makes your test resilient to setup failures.
