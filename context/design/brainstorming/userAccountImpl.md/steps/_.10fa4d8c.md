# Connecting Back to Assignment Requirements

This test suite directly addresses the key requirements in the assignment rubric:

* **Principle Tests**: The first test case is explicitly named for and implements the concept's operational principle.
* **Variant Tests**: We have provided three distinct variant tests that cover failure cases and edge conditions (duplicate data, bad password, non-existent user). This fulfills the "3-5 test executions" requirement.
* **Programmatic & Legible**: The tests use `assertEquals` to check outcomes automatically, and the `console.log` statements provide the "helpful messages" required to make the output legible for a human reader.
* **Coverage**: All actions (`register` and `login`) are executed successfully in at least one scenario.
* **No State Setup**: The `beforeEach` block ensures a clean slate, and all necessary state (like creating a user) is done by calling concept actions within the tests themselves, not by manually inserting data into the database.
