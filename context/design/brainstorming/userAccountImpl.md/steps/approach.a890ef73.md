# approach: How to Test the `UserAccountConcept`

We will create a test script file using the Deno testing framework. This script will:

1. Connect to a test database and ensure it's clean before each test runs.
2. Test the **Operational Principle**: A user can successfully register and then log in.
3. Test **Variant Scenarios**:
   * Attempting to register with an email that is already in use.
   * Attempting to log in with a correct email but an incorrect password.
   * Attempting to log in with an email that does not exist.
4. Print helpful messages to the console to make the test execution easy to follow, as required by the assignment.
5. Use programmatic assertions to automatically check for success or failure.
