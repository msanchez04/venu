# problem:

The error message `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'close')` tells you that the variable `client` is `undefined` at the exact moment the code tries to run `await client.close();`.

Here is the sequence of events that leads to this error:

1. Your test step starts, and it enters the `try` block.
2. The first line it attempts to execute is `[db, client] = await testDb();`.
3. **Something inside the `testDb()` function is throwing an error.** This could be because it can't find the `.env` file, the `DB_URI` variable is missing, the connection string is wrong, or your IP isn't whitelisted on MongoDB Atlas.
4. Because an error was thrown, the execution of the `try` block **stops immediately**. The variables `db` and `client` are never assigned a value. They remain `undefined`.
5. The JavaScript runtime immediately jumps to the `finally` block (because `finally` *always* runs, whether there was an error or not).
6. Inside the `finally` block, the code tries to run `await client.close()`. Since `client` is still `undefined`, this results in the `TypeError` you are seeing.
