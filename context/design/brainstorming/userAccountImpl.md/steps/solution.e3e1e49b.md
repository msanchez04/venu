# solution:

To fix this, we need to perform a type check to ensure that `e` is the specific error type thrown by the MongoDB driver for a duplicate key violation, which is `MongoServerError`.

1. We will import `MongoServerError` from the `mongodb` package.
2. Inside the `catch` block, we will use an `if` statement with the `instanceof` operator to check if `e` is an instance of `MongoServerError`.
3. If it is, TypeScript will intelligently "narrow" the type of `e` within that `if` block, allowing us to safely access the `.code` property without an error.

Here is the updated implementation for the `UserAccount` concept.
