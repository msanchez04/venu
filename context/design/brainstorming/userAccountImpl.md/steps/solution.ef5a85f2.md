# solution:

The safest and clearest way to solve this is to avoid destructuring directly into your pre-declared `let` variables. Instead, we can assign the result to a temporary `const` variable first. This allows TypeScript's inference to correctly recognize the tuple structure, and then we can assign the elements from there.

This approach is slightly more verbose but is 100% type-safe and easy to understand.

### Update the `beforeEach` block in your test file
