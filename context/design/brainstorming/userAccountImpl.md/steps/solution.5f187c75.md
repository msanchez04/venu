# solution: How to Run Your Deno Test File

To execute this test, you need to use the `deno test` command in your terminal and provide it with the necessary permissions to access the network (for MongoDB) and environment variables (for your database connection string in `.env`).

### Method 1: The Direct Command

You can run your test file directly by specifying the path and the required flags.

1. **Open your terminal** at the root of your project.
2. **Run the following command**, replacing `tests/userAccount.test.ts` with the actual path to your test file if it's different:

```sh
deno test --allow-net --allow-env tests/userAccount.test.ts
```

* `deno test`: This is the command to invoke Deno's built-in test runner.
* `--allow-net`: Grants the script permission to make network connections, which is essential for connecting to your MongoDB database.
* `--allow-env`: Grants the script permission to read environment variables, which is how your `testDb()` function likely gets the database connection URI from your `.env` file.
* `tests/userAccount.test.ts`: The path to the file you want to test.

### Method 2: The Better Way (Using `deno.json` Tasks)

Typing out all those flags every time can be tedious. A much better practice is to create a `test` task in your `deno.json` file. This creates a simple, memorable shortcut.

1. **Open your `deno.json` file.**
2. **Add a `test` entry** to the `tasks` object. If you don't have a `tasks` object, create one.
