# response:

Of course. It's a great idea to understand how to use Deno's native testing API (`Deno.test`), as it's powerful and doesn't require the BDD-style syntax.

Here is the entire test file, rewritten to use `Deno.test` and its "test steps" feature, which is a perfect replacement for the `describe`/`it` structure you were using.
