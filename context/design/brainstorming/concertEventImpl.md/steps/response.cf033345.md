# response:

Of course. Following the detailed requirements from your assignment for testing concepts, here is a complete test file for the `ConcertEventConcept` using the Deno testing framework.

This test file includes:

1. A test for the **operational principle**.
2. Four additional tests covering **interesting scenarios** and edge cases.
3. Coverage for every action (`addConcert`, `editConcertDetails`).
4. Clear console output for legibility.
5. Programmatic assertions to verify behavior.
6. Proper setup and teardown to ensure tests are isolated and repeatable.

First, to make testing more robust, let's add a simple query method to the `ConcertEventConcept` class as suggested by the guidelines. This allows us to verify state changes without directly accessing the database in our tests.

### Updated `ConcertEventConcept.ts` (with query)

Add this method inside the `ConcertEventConcept` class in `src/ConcertEvent/ConcertEventConcept.ts`:

```typescript
// Add this method inside the ConcertEventConcept class

  /**
   * Retrieves a single concert by its ID.
   * @param id The ID of the concert to retrieve.
   * @returns The concert document or null if not found.
   */
  async _getConcertById({ id }: { id: ID }): Promise<{ concert: ConcertEventDoc | null }> {
    const concert = await this.concertEvents.findOne({ _id: id });
    return { concert };
  }
```

Now, here is the test file.
